Obfuscator,,,Anshuman Singh -7665977899,Akshit Jain-889019669
This event will be conducted in two parts. In first half, each team have to write obfuscated code for the specific simple problem given to the team.The team will be provided with the compiler for this part. After this, your code will be provided to every other team and you will be provided with the code of other teams. In second half, the teams have to go through the codes of other teams. And without actually running their code, they have to come up with the task being performed.

A water rocket employs a compressed gas to accelerate water through its nozzle as a means of propulsion. The water inside the rocket body is essentially stationary and is accelerated to the velocity at the nozzle expressed by Bernoulli's equation: P = ½ ?V2 Water rocket introduces you with real world physics especially aerodynamics. It gives you opportunity to test up to what extent your physics is applied and improves your understanding. Aero-modelling club IIT Rajasthan invites you to bring the creator in you and prove your understanding to aerodynamics.

The desire to fly is an idea handed down to us by our ancestors who... looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space... on the infinite highway of the air.”  ? Wilbur Wright Gliding is perhaps the most elegant way that humans can get airborne. It's a breath-taking way to fly, soaring on the same rising currents of air that the birds use, with no roaring engine to spoil the peace. This experience is a perfect introduction to gliding, giving you the chance to really get to grips with it. Here at IGNUS 2K14, we shall re-invent the principles of aerodynamics as applied to gliders, by implementing them to design and fabricate hand-made unmanned Balsa gliders. The powered aircraft that pulls the glider aloft gives the glider a certain amount of potential energy. The glider can trade the potential energy difference from a higher altitude to a lower altitude to produce kinetic energy, which means velocity. Gliders are always descending relative to the air in which they are flying.
