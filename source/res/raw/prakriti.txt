In areas where particles are present and cannot be otherwise eliminated, and people are particularly sensitive (a person with asthma), an air filtration unit is what could prove to be of immense importance to the residents. The smoke coming out from the industrial chimneys, effluents from cars, etc creating air pollution must be controlled. The future of the society is your hands. The society needs your help to solve this problem.

Many consumer durables are produced each year. Each time you buy a new product to replace an older one or are simply disposing off something that you don’t need anymore, where does it go? Might unfortunately end up somewhere that is NOT the place for it.You see, they’re usually non-biodegradable and also don’t come under other categories of junk; this is E-waste, management of which is of the highest concerns at the moment.

About 27 million children are born each year in India. But nearly 2 million of them do not live to the age of five. Official figures indicate that there are over 12 million child workers in India, but many NGOs reckon the real figure is up to 60 million. The number of girls involved is not much lower than the boys. The majority of children are enrolled in school, but up to half don't attend regularly. Many are pressured to work and earn money for their families. Everyday nearly 50,000 tons of municipal solid waste is generated in the urban areas of India. All these data shows that Child labour, illiteracy and health are the modern-day phantoms that cripple our country's growth and pollution, dirtiness making this world a worst place to live. The event AAKRITI aims to give shape to these demons, that we may successfully eradicate them.
