There has been a massive fire outbreak in remote location of a town, we are the one responsible for Preventing any big hazard ,the fire is so massive that no human can enter in fire zone so to tackle this situation ,you have to design a robot which can be wirelessly controlled this would act as the saviour of people trapped in the danger zone.

The desire to fly is an idea handed down to us by our ancestors who... looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space... on the infinite highway of the air.”  ? Wilbur Wright Gliding is perhaps the most elegant way that humans can get airborne. It's a breath-taking way to fly, soaring on the same rising currents of air that the birds use, with no roaring engine to spoil the peace. This experience is a perfect introduction to gliding, giving you the chance to really get to grips with it. Here at IGNUS 2K14, we shall re-invent the principles of aerodynamics as applied to gliders, by implementing them to design and fabricate hand-made unmanned Balsa gliders. The powered aircraft that pulls the glider aloft gives the glider a certain amount of potential energy. The glider can trade the potential energy difference from a higher altitude to a lower altitude to produce kinetic energy, which means velocity. Gliders are always descending relative to the air in which they are flying.
