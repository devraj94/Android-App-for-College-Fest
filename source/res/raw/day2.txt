AAKRITI,,,Ashutosh Gupta-9571497630,Sangram Gaikwad-7791955542
About 27 million children are born each year in India. But nearly 2 million of them do not live to the age of five. Official figures indicate that there are over 12 million child workers in India, but many NGOs reckon the real figure is up to 60 million. The number of girls involved is not much lower than the boys. The majority of children are enrolled in school, but up to half don't attend regularly. Many are pressured to work and earn money for their families. Everyday nearly 50,000 tons of municipal solid waste is generated in the urban areas of India. All these data shows that Child labour, illiteracy and health are the modern-day phantoms that cripple our country's growth and pollution, dirtiness making this world a worst place to live. The event AAKRITI aims to give shape to these demons, that we may successfully eradicate them.
